'''The Definition Function:'''
'''
Most Python programs consist of functions. Functions in Python allow programmers to \
add functionality in their programs that might be needed again and again throughout \
the program's execution run. With functions, programmers can call/execute functions \
from another file as part of the main program’s execution run from the main file. Note: \
calling files from other files must be stored within the same directory path or folder; via \
Windows for example. Functions can also return values, which can be changed or modified \
throughout the program’s execution run. Just remember that functions simply add \
functionality. Also remember the acronym or abbreviation (DRY): Don’t Repeat Yourself!           
'''
# Definition functions are called def functions for short. Def function statements
# always start with the word ‘def’ followed by parameters or without parameters.
# However, all def statements must proceed with a semicolon (:) at the end of all def
# statements. For example, def example(): is a function without parameters, whereas
# def example(self,name,age): has three parameters. The semicolon assures that any
# program statements underneath the def statements are always indented, which is
# Python’s way of keeping the program statements as part of the complete def
# function. Note: any program statements, which are not indented will simply be
# bypassed altogether, meaning they won’t be executed as part of the def function at
# all; thus creating potential errors to occur. Now it's time to get your feet a little bit
# more wet. Are you ready?

# Like strings, def functions must not have any empty spaces between words. Use an
# underscore ie: (_) in place of empty spaces instead.

# This small program shows no output whatsoever on the screen.

# Change for  git check1
# Change for  git check2
# Change for  git check3

# the function's call statement, you will get an index out of range error; thus crashing
# the prgram. It's imperative that, including simple strings or anything that takes
# variables and values must always be equal to be satisfied. As for the print statement,
# you can leave out arguments, and use them later on. Here is an example of what the
# very same program below does when you leave out some arguments within the print
